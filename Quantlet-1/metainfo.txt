  This Quantlet performs blockchain-based transaction analytics across industries.
  It loads, cleans, and transforms the dataset (bcn.csv), engineers time-based
  features, encodes categorical fields, computes descriptive statistics, conducts
  fraud analysis, and creates two visualizations: order amount distribution and 
  fraud vs. non-fraud order amount comparison. Results are saved to the /output folder.
